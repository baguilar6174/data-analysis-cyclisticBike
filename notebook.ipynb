    "# Cyclistic bike-share Analysis Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study is about a fictitious company, Cyclistic. Where I will answer business questions, following the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclistic's marketing director believes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual members. Therefore, his team wants to understand how casual users and annual members use Cyclistic's bikes differently. From this information, his team will design a new marketing strategy to convert occasional riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve their recommendations, so they must be backed by compelling data and professional data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characters and teams\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.ç These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cyclistic marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals—as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cyclistic executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the company\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A clear statement of the business task\n",
    "2. A description of all data sources used\n",
    "3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\n",
    "4. A summary of your analysis\n",
    "5. Supporting visualizations and key findings\n",
    "6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ask phase\n",
    "\n",
    "Three questions will guide the future marketing program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n",
    "2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n",
    "3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? \n",
    "\n",
    "The question to answer: **How do annual members and occasional riders differ in their use of Cyclistic bikes?****\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guiding questions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the problem I'm trying to solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem at hand is understanding the differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic bikes. By uncovering these distinctions, we aim to develop targeted marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members, ultimately maximizing the number of annual memberships and fostering future growth for Cyclistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How can your insights drive business decisions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Insights derived from analyzing the usage patterns of annual members and casual riders will enable Cyclistic to make informed decisions regarding marketing strategies, resource allocation, and customer engagement initiatives. By understanding the behaviors and preferences of each customer segment, Cyclistic can tailor its marketing efforts to effectively target casual riders and encourage them to transition into annual members.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Identify the business task\n",
    "\n",
    "The business task is to analyze the usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes among annual members and casual riders to identify differences and trends. This analysis will inform the development of targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, aligning with Cyclistic's goal of maximizing annual memberships for future growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consider key stakeholders\n",
